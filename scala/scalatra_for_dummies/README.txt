This is an HTTP server. It shows how to do HTTP
listening, regexp and testing in Scala.

Getting started:
1. cd to this directory
2. "sbt test" - run all the tests
  (this takes a while the first time, as sbt downloads dependencies)
3. "sbt run" - starts the server
  (this currently does not respond to ctrl-c on Windows and must be killed with task manager)
4. Go and see the server in action:
  http://localhost:1337/?q=what+is+the+sum+of+8+and+22
5. Try and modify the number in the above URL and verify
  that the answer is correct
